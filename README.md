# 🚀 PyOS v2.0

> A Python-based terminal operating system simulator built entirely from scratch.

PyOS is a terminal-driven operating system simulator developed using Python. It is designed to simulate core operating system concepts such as authentication, filesystem handling, shell commands, app execution, logging, themes, permissions, and AI-assisted terminal interaction.

PyOS is both:

* a learning project for operating system and systems programming concepts
* a modular shell ecosystem inspired by real-world terminal environments

* First-boot admin setup
* User account creation
* Login system
* Password validation
* Password hashing
* Role-based permissions
* Account lock system after failed attempts
* Separate admin and user environments

---

## 🖥️ Interactive Shell

PyOS provides a terminal-style shell environment.

Example:

```bash
PyOS:/home/username>
```

Supports:

* command parsing
* command permissions

| `deldir` | Delete directory           |
| `cr`     | Create file                |
| `del`    | Delete file                |
| `copy`   | Copy files                 |
| `rename` | Rename files/directories   |
| `readf`  | Read file contents         |

# ⚙️ Installation

## Requirements

* Python 3.10+
* Windows CMD Terminal

---

## Clone Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

---

## Start PyOS

Run:

```bash
boot.bat
```

Do NOT run:

```bash
python main.py
```

because PyOS uses a dedicated bootloader system.
